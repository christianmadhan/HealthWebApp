# Bertha Project
This is a school project on 3rd semester. This project is about interacting with user data, connecting the data from a database to a website through a web api.  The web api is wrinting in C# and the webpage is typescript, html and scss.

## Security
Everything was created with security as one of the highest priority. When you handle user data, this is one of the most important steps. We created the web api with special authentication for the login part. The web api also have CORS only enable for specific domains.
